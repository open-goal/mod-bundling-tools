# OpenGOAL Mod Distribution Tools

**This is still being actively developed and may change, use at your own risk**

This repo contains some github actions, scripts, and JSON schemas to attempt to simplify and standardize OpenGOAL mod formats.

Note that overtime this action may change as the underlying expected structure of mods change.  One of the benefits of using these actions is that complying with said changes should be as easy as using the latest version.
